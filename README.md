# 121-Final-project# Devlog Entry - [11/14/2024]

## Introducing the team
Tools Lead: Elliot Ahlstroem
Engine Lead: Raven Cruz
Design Lead: Liza Gitelman & Jackie Sanchez

## Tools and materials
The team will be developing a webgame using JavaScript.  This engine used will be the Phaser3 Engine.  We are choosing this engine because we are most comfortable with the libraries and capabilities of Phaser3.  Javasript is utilized in Phaser3, thus why we are using it.  

The team will be utilizing VSCode for all code writing.  Visual assets are made with Asesprite and/or will get assets from public domains.  We will be using Tiled for level design.  We chose these due to our familiarity of the tools and compatibility with Phaser3.
Public Domain Credits: TBD

Alternatively, our second platform of choice is Godot.  This will change the language used to C#.  Assets can still be made with the previously stated tools for this platform as well.

## Outlook
What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
Our team is hoping to be able to create a game that is more easily deployed and accessible to us as the developers.  This will also allow for quicker playtesting because of the quick turn around for deployment.  

What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
The riskiest part of the project is potentially having to switch to a different platform that none of us have too much experience with.

What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
The team is hoping to expand their limited knowledge of Phaser3 and also learn to make cleaner code while working with a team.

## Resources
In creating the tilemap & tileset, we used the Tiled software (https://www.mapeditor.org/) and Kenney's Tiny Town tileset (https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town)
